Hacker News V3.0
Hacker News is an excellent resource for front end engineers, but it looks quite ugly - have a look here: https://news.ycombinator.com/ .
Luckily, there is an Official Hacker News API (https://github.com/HackerNews/API ) that we can use to create a better version.

Using Angular, React, Vue or other modern Javascript frameworks, utilise the HackerNews API to create a redesigned hacker news web application.

Minimum requirements:

Redesign the front page
The user should be able to choose between new and top posts
The posts can be shown in any way you like (grid/list etc.)
How you handle pagination of the posts to display is up to you, but you should be able to load as many posts as the API permits while achieving a clean UX

What weâ€™re looking for:

A clean, easy to use UI
Use of best practices in the framework of your choice
Readable and DRY code
We value test coverage
Make the code available in a Git-based source code repository e.g. Github. (Please make the repository name a random string and avoid references to Genesys to prevent others copying your code in the future.)
State any assumptions that you made
Please include a readme file for your solution in the repo

Aside from what is outlined above, you have free reign in any design decisions and implementation details.

Naturally, StackOverflow and coding assistants like ChatGPT exist. While we cannot prevent you from using these, we expect that you fully own any code you submit and can talk to it comprehensively in a follow-up interview. In your day-to-day work, knowing your dependencies and the rationale of design decisions is crucial, and we expect the same of you in your coding challenge.
